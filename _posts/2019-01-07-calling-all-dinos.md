title: Calling All Dinos!
---

Happy new year Scouts and Scouters!  Are you ready for the cold weather to be over, and for Summer to come?  Well, warm up to this day camp news.

This year's theme will be "dinosaurs," and with it will come new opportunities for Cub Scout fun!  To make this happen, we will need volunteers of all types.

One important role is that of a unit liason.  The unit liason assists day camp staff with communication between the unit and the camp, especially in the weeks leading up to camp.  It us useful to have a unit liason for both Cub Scout Packs, as well as Troops and Crews that may be sending us Youth Staff.  For more information on adding your name to the unit liason list, see the [unit info page](/units).

Additionally, we need every other kind of volunteer as well.  See the below document for a description of volunteer positions.  If you have an interest in any position listed here, please fill out the following interest form and we will get back with you.
