Registration is now open!

All campers and volunteers should download the [attached form](/public/content/forms/2019-daycamp-packet.pdf) and send it, along with payment, to the appropriate person within their Pack, Troop, or Crew.  If a camper or volunteer is unsure who to send the form to, they should contact their local unit committee for more information.  All registrations should go through the local unit.

Out of district campers should contact [crosstimbersdaycamp@gmail.com](mailto:crosstimbersdaycamp@gmail.com).

# Newletter Update to Unit Leaders

Registration is now open for unit liaisons!

## Registration is now open.

The online registration system is now open.  This means that your unit can officially register for camp.  For your convenience, we have posted the registration packets [on our website](https://crosstimbersdaycamp.github.io/registration/).  If you would like copies of these documents in Word Document or OpenDocument Format so that you can add unit-specific information or to perform a mail-merge, please email [crosstimbersdaycamp@gmail.com](mailto:crosstimbersdaycamp@gmail.com).

Please note that we encourage unit liaisons to facilitate registration as a unit when entering data into the online system.  The online system technically can be completed by individual families, but it will not collect enough information by itself and paper forms will still be required.  Additionally, the online system does not know how much camp card credit a family may have.  So unit liaisons will almost certainly need to be involved in the registration process.

We hope to provide a detailed guide on performing registration for a unit this year, so stay tuned for that as we get closer to the deadline.

_Additional note: There is a typo on our registration page on scoutingevent.com, and we have already sent a request to have it corrected.  The correct price for campers is $110 for early registration and $130 for late registration._

## Training Dates

Adult volunteers and youth staff should make plans to attend one of the following trainings.  These sessions will cover expectations, camp procedures, and the information you will need in order to provide a safe and fun camp experience.

- May 11, 2019 9 A.M.-12 P.M
- May 25, 2019 9 A.M.-12 P.M

## Changes to Character References

In past years, a photocopy of a BSA Member ID Card was sufficient to satisfy the character reference requirement for adult volunteers.  This is no longer the case as of this year.  All adult volunteers must have a character reference whether they are a BSA member or not.

## Tell us who your unit liaison is.

We still have units without identified unit liaisons.  We need to know who to contact in your unit to make sure that information flows smoothly in both directions.  The role of a Unit Liaison is to distribute information to the unit, and to help us by ensuring that forms are collected correctly and on-time.

Sometimes, the unit liaison is a member of the Key 3, but not always.  The best Unit Liaisons are excited about camp, and can convey that excitement to the youth.

We need a liaison for every unit that will be in-camp, including packs, troops, and crews.  Please reach out to us at [crosstimbersdaycamp@gmail.com](mailto:crosstimbersdaycamp@gmail.com) or [the unit page on our website](/units/).

## Liaisons and Key 3, we need your help...

The Cross Timbers Twilight Camp Committee meets once or twice a month to plan and prepare for this upcoming year.  We would love for you to participate in this process and to provide feedback.  Let us know at [crosstimbersdaycamp@gmail.com](mailto:crosstimbersdaycamp@gmail.com) if you would like to receive meeting invites.

## I'm in a Troop/Crew.  Why am I getting this?

Every safari needs safari guides... and Twilight Camp is an exciting way for older scouts to get service hours and develop leadership skills. 

Any scout or venture-aged youth is eligible to be a Councilor-in-Training, and registered youth over the age of 14 are permitted to take on larger areas of responsibility.  We need older scouts to be instructors and to help with dens and to assist in program areas.  Some areas of responsibility include: assistant den leaders, quartermasters, fire guard, craft/sport/STEM instructors, and more.

Training and leadership experience is not required, but a can-do attitude is!

Please let us know if your unit's schedule is compatible with Twilight Camp, and whether you expect scouts to come and join us.  You can reach us at [crosstimbersdaycamp@gmail.com](mailto:crosstimbersdaycamp@gmail.com) or fill out [the unit liaison form here](/units/).
