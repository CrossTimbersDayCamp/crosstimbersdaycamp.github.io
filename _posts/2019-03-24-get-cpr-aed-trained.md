title: Get CPR/AED Trained
---

If you need CPR/AED training, now is the time to get it done.  There are discounted classes available at the [Longhorn Activity Center](https://www.longhorncouncil.org/camps-properties/longhorn-activity-center/) for only $30.  These classes can run $100 when taken elsewhere.

Additionally, when you come to our camp as a CPR/AED trained volunteer, you help our camp ensure that we provide the safest program possible for the youth in attendance.  We require half of our camp staff to be trained and certified, and it is a great value to the camp to have other volunteers be certified as well.  Please mark on your registration form if you are CPR/AED certified and include a copy of your certification card at the time of registration.

For schedules and to register, visit the [Longhorn Council website](https://www.longhorncouncil.org/event/wilderness-first-aid-cpr-courses/) for more information.
