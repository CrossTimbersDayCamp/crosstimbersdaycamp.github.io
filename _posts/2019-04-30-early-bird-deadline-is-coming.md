title: Early Bird Deadline is Coming

[![Notify Your Unit](/public/content/images/notify-your-pack.png)](/public/content/forms/2019-daycamp-packet.pdf)

The early-bird deadline is fast approaching!

## Register before May 18th for the early-bird discount

The online registration system is now open.  This means that your unit can officially register for camp.  For your convenience, we have posted the registration packets [on our website](https://crosstimbersdaycamp.github.io/registration/).  If you would like copies of these documents in Word Document or OpenDocument Format so that you can add unit-specific information or to perform a mail-merge, please email [crosstimbersdaycamp@gmail.com](mailto:crosstimbersdaycamp@gmail.com).

Please note that we encourage unit liaisons to facilitate registration as a unit when entering data into the online system.  The online system technically can be completed by individual families, but it will not collect enough information by itself and paper forms will still be required.  Additionally, the online system does not know how much camp card credit a family may have.  So unit liaisons will almost certainly need to be involved in the registration process.

Update: We had hoped to provide a detailed guide on performing registration for a unit this year, but we have not yet gotten administrative access to the online registration system, so we can't process example registrations.  We will try to have this for you next year.  If you have any problems registering, please send us an email at [crosstimbersdaycamp@gmail.com](mailto:crosstimbersdaycamp@gmail.com).

_Additional note: There is a typo on our registration page on scoutingevent.com, and we have already sent a request to have it corrected.  The correct price for campers is $110 for early registration and $130 for late registration._

## Reminder about YPT

In-person YPT will not be provided this year as the current version of the online YPT training satisfies the state requirements for youth camps.  All adults in camp must have up-to-date YPT in order to attend camp. 

## Training Dates

Adult volunteers and youth staff should make plans to attend one of the following trainings.  These sessions will cover expectations, camp procedures, and the information you will need in order to provide a safe and fun camp experience.

- May 11, 2019 9 A.M.-12 P.M
- May 25, 2019 9 A.M.-12 P.M

Update: This year we will be offering the training material in an online format in addition to the traditional in-person trainings.  We are hoping that this will increase the number of trained staff and volunteers.  Stay tuned for more information on this next week. 

## Expect a phone call.

We still have units without identified unit liaisons.  Someone will be calling all units in the district this week to find out whether they plan to come to Day Camp.  If a unit liaison has not been identified for the unit, we will call the committee chair.

For more information about liaisons, please reach out to us at  [crosstimbersdaycamp@gmail.com](mailto:crosstimbersdaycamp@gmail.com) or [the unit page on our website](/units/).

## I'm in a Troop/Crew.  Why am I getting this?

Every safari needs safari guides... and Twilight Camp is an exciting way for older scouts to get service hours and develop leadership skills. 

Any scout or venture-aged youth is eligible to be a Councilor-in-Training, and registered youth over the age of 14 are permitted to take on larger areas of responsibility.  We need older scouts to be instructors and to help with dens and to assist in program areas.  Some areas of responsibility include: assistant den leaders, quartermasters, fire guard, craft/sport/STEM instructors, and more.

Training and leadership experience is not required, but a can-do attitude is!

Please let us know if your unit's schedule is compatible with Twilight Camp, and whether you expect scouts to come and join us.  You can reach us at [crosstimbersdaycamp@gmail.com](mailto:crosstimbersdaycamp@gmail.com) or fill out [the unit liaison form here](/units/).
