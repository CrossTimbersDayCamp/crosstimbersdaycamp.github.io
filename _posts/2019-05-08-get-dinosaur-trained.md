It's time to get DINOSAUR TRAINED!

## Training Updates

Day Camp training will be offered in two formats.  In-person training will be available on the following dates: 

- May 11, 2019 9 A.M.-12 P.M. at Trinity UMC
- May 25, 2019 9 A.M.-12 P.M. at Trinity UMC

Online training can be completed from home, at your own pace by clicking on the following link: [http://bit.ly/2UrlZF1](http://bit.ly/2UrlZF1).  Online training will only be considered complete if the quiz is completed at the end of the training.

Both training formats are estimated to take between 1 - 1.5 hrs.  This training can also be found from the [Day Camp website](/2019/05/08/get-dinosaur-trained/).

Due to new requirements pertaining to Youth-on-Youth Prevention Training, training is required for camp staff.  This includes the Day Camp Committee, Camp and Program Directors, Area Directors, Instructors, and Youth Staff.

## Reminder about YPT

In-person YPT will not be provided this year as the current version of the online YPT training satisfies the state requirements for youth camps.  All adults in camp must have up-to-date YPT in order to attend camp. 

## I'm in a Troop/Crew.  Why am I getting this?

Every safari needs safari guides... and Twilight Camp is an exciting way for older scouts to get service hours and develop leadership skills. 

Any scout or venture-aged youth is eligible to be a Councilor-in-Training, and registered youth over the age of 14 are permitted to take on larger areas of responsibility.  We need older scouts to be instructors and to help with dens and to assist in program areas.  Some areas of responsibility include: assistant den leaders, quartermasters, fire guard, craft/sport/STEM instructors, and more.

Training and leadership experience is not required, but a can-do attitude is!

Please let us know if your unit's schedule is compatible with Twilight Camp, and whether you expect scouts to come and join us.  You can reach us at [crosstimbersdaycamp@gmail.com](mailto:crosstimbersdaycamp@gmail.com) or fill out [the unit liaison form here](/units/).
