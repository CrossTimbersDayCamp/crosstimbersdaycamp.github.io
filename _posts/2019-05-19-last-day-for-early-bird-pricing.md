## Last Day for Early Bird Pricing!

Unit Liaisons, this note is for you.  There are only 36 hours left to enter participant registrations to secure the early bird pricing of $110.  Any participants submitted to the online system after Mon 05-27-2019 11:59 PM will have to pay $130.

We also encourage you to get tot lot, youth staff, and adults entered as well... but early-bird pricing only applies to participants.  So if you're running short on time, focus on getting the kids entered.

If you have any questions, call or text the Camp Director, Cameron King.  His phone number is 682-999-0991.

- Parents can find a digital copy of the registration form here: [https://crosstimbersdaycamp.github.io/registration/](https://crosstimbersdaycamp.github.io/registration/)
- Unit Liaisons can register participants here: [https://scoutingevent.com/662-25620-60876](https://scoutingevent.com/662-25620-60876)

At this time we have 70 participants, 19 youth staff, and 26 adults registered.  We expect to see over 100 participants in camp, and we are excited to watch the numbers go up as we get closer and closer to camp.  We'll see you there! 

## Update on Training

Thank you to the 9 volunteers and youth staff that attended the last training session.  Training took almost exactly 1.5 hours, and contains updates to camp procedures and other information that volunteers and staff will need to conduct camp activities.

To date, 6 volunteers and staff have chosen to do the [online training option](https://crosstimbersdaycamp.github.io/2019/05/08/get-dinosaur-trained/).  This option puts the training slideshow into your hands, which you can review at your own pace.  At the end of the training, there is a quiz, which will ensure that the key material is understood and will serve to record course completion.

The next training date is Sat, May 25 at 9pm at Trinity United Methodist Church (where we will have camp).  If you attended either the previous session, or completed online training, you do not need to come to this session.

Youth staff, as well as anyone engaged by the Day Camp Committee on an ongoing basis (year over year, or in a position of significant responsibility) is required to have this training.  The training is strongly recommended for all volunteers. 

## Reminder about YPT

In-person YPT will not be provided this year as the current version of the online YPT training satisfies the state requirements for youth camps.  All adults in camp must have up-to-date YPT in order to attend camp. 

## I'm in a Troop/Crew.  Why am I getting this?

Every safari needs safari guides... and Twilight Camp is an exciting way for older scouts to get service hours and develop leadership skills. 

Any scout or venture-aged youth is eligible to be a Councilor-in-Training, and registered youth over the age of 14 are permitted to take on larger areas of responsibility.  We need older scouts to be instructors and to help with dens and to assist in program areas.  Some areas of responsibility include: assistant den leaders, quartermasters, fire guard, craft/sport/STEM instructors, and more.

Training and leadership experience is not required, but a can-do attitude is!

Please let us know if your unit's schedule is compatible with Twilight Camp, and whether you expect scouts to come and join us.  You can reach us at [crosstimbersdaycamp@gmail.com](mailto:crosstimbersdaycamp@gmail.com) or fill out [the unit liaison form here](/units/).
