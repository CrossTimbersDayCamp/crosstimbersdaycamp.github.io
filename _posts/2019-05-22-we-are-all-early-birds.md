title: We are all Early Birds
---

_This is the second update regarding early bird pricing._

Three emails from us one one week?  Madness!  But it's all good news.

Early Bird Pricing has been extended through the end of the online registration period.  All participants who register online will pay the Early Bird price of $110.  Walk-up registrations will still be $130.  (Walk-up registration is for exceptional circumstances only, and shirts and other materials are not guaranteed.  Register in advance!)

The final cut-off for units to register everyone for camp online is 06-03-2019 11:59 PM. 

- Parents can find a digital copy of the registration form here: [https://crosstimbersdaycamp.github.io/registration/](https://crosstimbersdaycamp.github.io/registration/)
- Unit Liaisons can register participants here: [https://scoutingevent.com/662-25620-60876](https://scoutingevent.com/662-25620-60876)

## Reminder about YPT

In-person YPT will not be provided this year as the current version of the online YPT training satisfies the state requirements for youth camps.  All adults in camp must have up-to-date YPT in order to attend camp. 

## I'm in a Troop/Crew.  Why am I getting this?

Every safari needs safari guides... and Twilight Camp is an exciting way for older scouts to get service hours and develop leadership skills. 

Any scout or venture-aged youth is eligible to be a Councilor-in-Training, and registered youth over the age of 14 are permitted to take on larger areas of responsibility.  We need older scouts to be instructors and to help with dens and to assist in program areas.  Some areas of responsibility include: assistant den leaders, quartermasters, fire guard, craft/sport/STEM instructors, and more.

Training and leadership experience is not required, but a can-do attitude is!

Please let us know if your unit's schedule is compatible with Twilight Camp, and whether you expect scouts to come and join us.  You can reach us at [crosstimbersdaycamp@gmail.com](mailto:crosstimbersdaycamp@gmail.com) or fill out [the unit liaison form here](/units/).
