## Day Camp Roundup - 6/9 at 3pm

One parent from each family who will be attending Day Camp must attend the Day Camp Roundup at Trinity United Methodist Church to confirm paperwork and receive your orientation and camp shirt.  Roundup begins at 3pm and ends at 6pm, and is come-and-go.

Trinity United Methodist Church is located at 1200 W Green Oaks Blvd, Arlington, TX 76013.

If a parent cannot come to roundup, they must reach out to camp staff at crosstimbersdaycamp@gmail.com rather than sending a delegate.  There is important orientation information that all families need to hear from camp staff before camp.

If you are missing any of the following information, you must bring it to Day Camp Roundup.  All of these documents must be in order before anyone can receive shirts or enter camp.

- Registration Form
- Volunteer Contract (for adults and youth staff)
- Medical Form parts A & B
    - Copy of insurance card
    - Tetanus shot date for adults
    - Full shot record for youth (or exemption)
- Printed Copy of YPT card or certification (for any adult in camp)

Copies of these forms can be found [here](https://crosstimbersdaycamp.github.io/registration/).

Instructions for printing a YPT certificate can be found [here](https://blog.scoutingmagazine.org/2018/09/26/how-to-make-sure-youve-taken-youth-protection/).

## Day Camp Setup - 6/8 at 9am

If you are available to help setup the camp, please meet us at Trinity this Saturday at 9am.  Setup is expected to take approximately 2 hours, but we will continue working until the preparations are complete.  The more volunteers we have to help us setup, the faster the work will go.
