We've finally gotten all of our loose ends tied up and have had a chance to reflect on our week of camp.  All things considered, we had a fantastic week, and from the feedback we've gotten the kids really enjoyed the activities.  We want to give a special thank you to Atmos Energy and the Arlington Police Department who each sent multiple experts to talk to the kids at our camp.  We appreciate the time and energy of all of our volunteers, staff, guest speakers, and parents for making this years camp a great success.

We would love to hear from all of our parents!  Click on this link to fill out the post-camp survey: [bit.ly/XTTC2019](http://bit.ly/XTTC2019)

If a scout attended camp every day, he likely completed the following requirements:
