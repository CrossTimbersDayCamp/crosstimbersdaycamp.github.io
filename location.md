Our camp is located on the property of [Trinity United Methodist Church](https://trinityarl.org/) in Arlington, TX.  This location affords us a safe, roomy space to host our twilight camp program.  Trinity provides an indoor meeting area, as well as a large field, so scouts will alternate between indoor and outdoor activities to prevent overheating.
